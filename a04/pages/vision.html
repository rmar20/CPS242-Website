        <h3>About Nature's Source: Vision and Mission</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to design a service that allows customers to order food online from a variety of restaurants in the local area. We want to help the local community sell food, receive food, and deliver food.</p>
        <p>Restaurants that sign up for our services no longer have to pay for their own delivery services, or now have delivery options available if they did not already have them.  When ordering food, customers are able to browse or search our website for local restaurants. After a customer places an order, the order will be assigned to one of our drivers, who will go to the restaurant to retrieve the food and take it to the customer at their home, workplace, or anywhere they chose to have their food delivered to. This means that our service provides added convenience not only for the customers, but also for restaurants as they do not need to have their own delivery system in place to cater to these customers. </p>
        <p>This website is not only convenient, but can prove to be essential for customers who are busy and without any time to spare, ineligible to drive and pick up their food for themselves, unable to leave their houses for medical reasons, or just prefer to have their food delivered to them.</p>
