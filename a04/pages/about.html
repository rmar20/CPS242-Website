            <h2>About Quick Eats</h2><br>
            <p>Based in Dayton, OH, Quick Eats was founded in 2020 with the mission to help strengthen communities around the world by working in them on a local level.  </p><br>
            <p>Our lives are insanely busy and we aim to help people save time and energy.  Quick Eats seeks to eliminate the rush and stress of mealtime by acting as a delivery service for all of your favorite local restaurants.</p><br>
            <p>Not only do we seek to reduce the stress of daily life, but we also hold ourselves to high ethical standards. Our goal is to take care of everyone: the consumers, the producers, and all the people in between. Not only do we want to make meals more convenient, but we also seek to help the greater community.  Our drivers are paid competitive wages, flexible hours, and good benefits, allowing them to live their best lives.  In addition to our drivers, we promote local restaurants and chains over multinational corporations by reducing servicing fees.  By choosing local options, you are making a choice to support their community members.</p><br>
