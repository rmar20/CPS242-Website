        <h3>Your Health: Compute Your BMI</h3>
        <p>Coming soon ... a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. The first
        tool we will provide will be a calculator our clients can use
        to find their Body Mass Index, a numerical quantity that can be
        used to give some indication of whether a person's weight lies
        within a normal range. With the tendency to obesity among the
        general population these days, this should be a useful tool.</p>
        <h3>About BMI</h3>
        <p>Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height</p>
        <p>The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 25), overweight (25 to 30), and obese (over 30). BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-causes mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20â€“25 range.</p>
